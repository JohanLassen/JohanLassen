### Data scientist
E: johanlassen@live.dk | M: +45 60563035 | Aarhus, Denmark | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanklassen/)

I am finishing my Bioinformatics PhD in Dec. 2024, and I currently work with 
antibiotics resistance prediction using end-to-end deep learning on clinical data. Machine learning has been 
the focal point of my work, mostly applied in practice. Great motivators include working in cross-functional 
teams, running/closing well scoped projects, and learning new technologies that streamline my AI workflows. 
Finally, I have learned numerous programming languages/modules/tools during my PhD; while the overlap 
with the industry is not excessive, I have the skills to quickly get proficient in e.g., Azure/AWS, SQL, and 
Docker. 

Here are a few of my skills: 

| Skill | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Python | PyTorch, Lightning, Wandb, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc. |
| R | ggplot2, tidyverse stack, Shiny, caret, etc. |
| Machine Learning | Linear Models, Gradient boosting, PCA, UMAP, CNNs, Transformers, Autoencoders, etc. |
| Workflow management | Snakemake, GWF, High Performance Computing |
| Other tools | Bash, Git, Linux |
| Non-technical skills | Science communication, Visualization, Competitive |
