Most people will experience a disease where early intervention could have impacted the outcome. Hence, early diagnosis is key in most diagnostic tasks ranging from cancer to osteoporosis. 

In this study we presented a back to the future approach, using blood donors considered healthy during their donation period. By a data base search we identified patients who later got diagnosed with oesteoporosis and performed molecular analysis on the stored blood samples. For some samples we traversed up to six years back in time to catch the progresssion and dynamics of the disease.

At the same time we were able at finding matched pairs for the control group, who were as close to technical and biological replicates as possible. Hence, when identifying the metabolites that were significantly different between the two groups, we could be sure that the differences were due to the disease and not due to technical or biological variation.

We used a combination of logistic regression and random forest to identify the metabolites that were significantly different between the two groups. The results were promising and we were able to identify a set of metabolites that were significantly different between the two groups.

Often biomarker research suffer from day-to-day variance in the data. By using longitudinal data we were able to identify metabolites that were consistently changing over several years. 

This highlights one very important take away: collect the data that answers your question. In this case, we wanted to identify metabolites that were changing over time, hence we needed longitudinal data.

The study is currently available as preprint and can be found [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4642034/v1).
